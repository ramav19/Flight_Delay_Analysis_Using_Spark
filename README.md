# Flight-Delay-Analysis-using-Scala
This project performs an analysis of Flight delays in the US. We built machine learning models to predict future delays for a flight path.
Initialization_Visualization.scala is the first file that has to be run. It imports the data and cleans it. Exploratory Data Analysis is also done. Other files include code for the different machine learning algorithms used.
